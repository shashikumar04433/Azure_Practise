## Fedrated Credentials:

**1.What Are Federated Credentials?**
```
Federated credentials let an application or a service authenticate to a
cloud provider without storing secrets, passwords, or keys.
```
```
* Instead of hardcoding credentials, your cloud trusts an external identity provider (IdP)
(like GitHub, GitLab, Azure AD, Google, etc.) to issue tokens.
```
